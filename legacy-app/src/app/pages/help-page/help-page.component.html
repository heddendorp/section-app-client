      How do I sign up for multiple events?

      If you plan to sign up for multiple events in one office visit, please take your phone, open the events you're
      interested in and hit "Add to saved events" below the event QR code. <br/>

      Can I sign up for my friends?
    </mat-expansion-panel-header>
    <p>
      <strong>Yes!</strong>&nbsp;Please ask your friends to take screenshots of the QR-codes and bring them to the
      office, you can show them and sign your friends up that way. <br/>
      If the event has online registration your friends will have to sign up on their app.

      Registration notes
    </mat-expansion-panel-header>
    <p>
      We only accept cash for payments. <br/>
      As the number of participants in each event is limited, the “first come, first serve” principle applies. <br/>
      Often, places are left the week before an event. If you are very keen on attending the event, please drop by at
      our office the week before (ideally the Friday before an event on a weekend).<br/>
      Participation in all TUMi events is voluntary. Legal liability provisions apply. Accident coverage through the
      Bayerische Landesunfallkasse is therefore not provided.<br/>
      You may withdraw your confirmation of participation in an event until the last Monday before the event in question
      only. If you would like to withdraw at a later stage, please find somebody to replace you. Different registration
      rules may apply for events involving an overnight stay.<br/>
      Reimbursement of your attendance fee in the event of illness will only be provided if you submit a doctor's
      certificate within two weeks.<br/>
      As many events are subsidized by TUM, participation is limited to TUM students only. <br/>
      TUMi reserves the right to use event photos for internal purposes (showcase, website, flyers, etc.). Please let us
      know if you have any objections.
